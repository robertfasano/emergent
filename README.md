# labAPI
labAPI is a Python library featuring device drivers and abstract classes seeking to solve two main problems in experimental physics:
* Lack of a standard Internet of Things framework for device control 
* Over-reliance on manual optimization of experimental degrees of freedom

The ultimate goal of labAPI is to fully automate any physics experiment, not only providing standardized, scalable interfaces for control of large numbers of devices, but also allowing optimization and machine learning algorithms to be targeted at any devices in the experiment.

# EMERGENT
EMERGENT is a Python library featuring thing drivers and abstract classes seeking to solve two main problems in experimental physics:
* Lack of a standard Internet of Things framework for connected laboratories
* Over-reliance on manual optimization of experimental degrees of freedom

The ultimate goal of EMERGENT is to fully automate any physics experiment, not only providing standardized, scalable interfaces for hub of large numbers of things, but also allowing optimization and machine learning algorithms to be targeted at any things in the experiment.

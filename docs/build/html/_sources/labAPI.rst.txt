Overview
-------------------
labAPI is a library featuring device drivers and abstract classes allowing
universal control of laboratory experiments. However, actual experimental control
is not done in labAPI, but in a separate library implementing
labAPI's features for a specific use case.

In this tutorial, we will specifically work with the library controlling the NIST ytterbium portable optical lattice
clock experiment, which is called "portable". This library resides in the same
folder as labAPI, which is important for relative pathing.

Examples
-----------------
Git is used to track changes throughout development of labAPI. The repository
location is gitlab.nist.gov/rjf2/labAPI.
